# DVPetSpriteLocator_Test
A tool that can scan the digimon.csv file and locate sprites on each sheet or scan sheets to tell you the Digimon on them.

INSTALLATION
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Extract the files from the sprite locator to a folder of your choice.

Use an archiving tool like 7zip, winrar or winzip to open DVPet.jar

In the Model folder, find digimon.csv
Copy by extracting or drag & Dropping it to a folder of your choice

I highly recommend putting it in the same folder as your sprite locator as the program will automatically detect and load the file. Otherwise the program will prompt you for it.

Run DVSpriteLocator_Test.exe

Select the location of your digimon.csv if it was not loaded automatically
